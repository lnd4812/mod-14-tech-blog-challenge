# Title

Module-14 Tech Blog Challenge

## Description

This program requires the development of a blogging site for technology and users of such.  The Homepage features all posts that have been created and saved on the site, with the ability to create, edit, delete or comment on a post from the site's dashboard being restricted only to those logged into the site.  A user may create a new account through a separate link and once that account has been created, the user is brought to the dashboard page.  Once logged out, that user may subsequently access the dashboard by logging in with the saved username and password.

Output is based on the acceptance criteria outlined in the Module 14 Assignment Overview [Module-13-assignment](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1181/assignments/23366?module_item_id=465235).

An animated example of the expected layout of the blog is included in the Challenge outline.

## Credits

The majority of the program coding is based on that provided in the Module 13 and 14 main lesson.  As the challenge and acceptance criteria are so similar to those lessons and much of the terminology is based on standard practicies, it was very difficult not to do so.  As usual, several visits to Stack Overflow [website](https://stackoverflow.com) provided some finetuning or helped to clarify certain items in the modules.
