## Credits

The majority of the program coding is based on that provided in the Module 13 and 14 main lesson.  As the challenge and acceptance criteria are so similar to those lessons and much of the terminology is based on standard practicies, it was very difficult not to do so.  As usual, several visits to Stack Overflow [website](https://stackoverflow.com) provided some finetuning or helped to clarify certain items in the modules.
